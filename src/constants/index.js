      "● Designed and implemented a specialized register-register machine optimized for single-cycle bit-index operations.", 
"● Developed an instruction capable of identifying a 1-bit at a specific byte position in one cycle, reducing typical 3-cycle operations." ,
           "● Applied the architecture to use cases such as IEEE to fixed-point conversion and divisibility checks by powers of two.", 
           "● Improved processing efficiency by eliminating the need for multiple masking and AND operations in bit-level tasks."
